## Comparing Daily High Temperatures Over Time

I live in the South Jersey area and we ended up with an oddly warm Christmas. The warm temperatures started well before Christmas and continued straight through the holiday. It wasn't just warmer than normal, but five to ten degrees warmer. It got me curious about whether the temperatures leading up to and through Christmas were the highest on record, and by how much.

I decided to scrape data from [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/history/) for each individual date from Decmeber 23rd through December 26th.
